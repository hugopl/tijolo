# Tijolo Tasks

The rewrite isn't not just a plain GTK4 port but the implementation of the code widget with syntax highlighting, etc. So
it can take some time to finish... It will be release once I start using it to write itself, nowadays 0.8.0 is written
using version v0.7.x.

My original plan was to only release it with this new code widget ready, however this is too much work for the not much free
time I have to work on this, so I put the project manager hat on and decided to get it working first with GtkSourceView5,
then later replace GtkSourceView5 with my code widget, in the mean time it must compile with both widgets, this will force
me to add few abstractions to not depend on GtkSourceView5 API.

To compile it using the experimental/incomplete code widget use the `-Dexperimental` compiler flag.

## Pre re-write tasks

- [x] Create a [binding generator for GTK4](https://github.com/hugopl/gi-crystal).
- [x] Create a [GTK4 bidings](https://github.com/hugopl/gtk4.cr).
- [x] Create bindings for [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/).

## Tasks needed for a GtkSourceView5 based editor

- [x] Create GtkSourceView5 (GSV) bindings.
- [x] Add GSV to Tijolo and keep it compiling with both editor widgets (-Dexperimental).
- [x] Remove default key bindings from GSV.
- [x] Create a layout manager to let views be split in stacks again.
- [ ] Polish view split code.
- [x] Polish view navigation code.
- [ ] Port Tijolo 0.7 key bindings.
- [ ] Enclose selection with parentesis when typing `(`.
- [ ] Show project files on sidebar.
- [ ] Show current git branch somewhere (header bar?).
- [ ] Add menu to change branches.
- [ ] Change GSV style when changing dark/light themes.
- [ ] Create better color themes.
- [ ] Remove deprecated GTK stuff from Welcome widget.
- [ ] Remove trailing whitespaces on save.
- [ ] Implement text search.

## Tasks needed for a code editor widget

- [x] Draw editor background grid.
- [x] Draw cursors.
- [x] Move cursors.
- [x] Implement Scrollable interface.
- [x] Study tree-sitter.
- [x] Handle text input (just really basic stuff to be able to test few things).
- [x] Fix gi-crystal structs, so Pango can be used..
- [x] Create a CodeLayout object to cache line render nodes
- [x] Implement piecetable `#save`.
- [x] Implement piecetable `#insert`.
- [x] Implement piecetable `#delete`.
- [x] Let piecetable line aware.
- [ ] Implement piecetable `#line_col_to_pos`.
- [ ] Implement piecetable `#pos_line_col`.
- [ ] Implement piecetable `#line_size`.
- [ ] Balance tree used on piecetable (redblack or splay tree ü§îÔ∏è).
- [ ] Publish piece table shard.
- [ ] Use Piece Table shard in Tijolo.
- [ ] Keep tree-sitter code model up to date with piece table buffer.
- [ ] Use a splay tree with list behavior for code line cache of render nodes.
- [ ] Fix Pango bindings for `Pango::AttrList` class and `Pango::Attribute`.
- [ ] Render highlighted text with tree-sitter using `Pango::AttrList` instead of slow format strings.
- [ ] Implement text (multiple) selection model.
- [ ] Implement undo/redo for piece table.
- [ ] Have tree-sitter highlight queries for Crystal.
- [ ] Make cursors blink.
- [ ] Hide mouse when typing.
- [ ] Add [power mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-power-mode) for fun.
- [ ] Multiple cursors.
- [ ] Render tree-sitter errors.
- [ ] Support auto-completion
- [ ] Let piece table inform modified lines.
- [ ] Support custom editor gutter, so we can show a Kdevelop-like in-editor git blame.
- [ ] Add "Clone Repository" dialog.
- [ ] Add "New Project" dialog.
- [ ] Add settings dialog, or maybe just continue with the file based approach.
- [ ] Implement cursor position history.
- [ ] Save sessions.
- [ ] Word wrap.

## GI-Crystal improvements needed by Tijolo

- [ ] [Allow GObject signals with pure Crystal object as parameters](https://github.com/hugopl/gi-crystal/pull/75).
- [ ] Fix gi-crystal for methods with multiple out params, so some other Pango functions can be used.
- [ ] Implement `gtk_widget_class_add_binding_signal` on gtk4 shard, so shortcuts can be easily set.
- [ ] Implement a way to let Crystal objects being created by GtkBuilder on C land, so UI code can be simplified.
- [ ] Rework how GTK4 bindings uses template widgets, using a macro processing to not need the long annotations with list
      of ids and `template_child` calls.
