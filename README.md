# Tijolo

Lightweight, keyboard-oriented IDE for the masses.

[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/tijolo)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tijolo)
![Build Status](https://github.com/hugopl/tijolo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Project status

Current stable (pre-alpha) version is 0.7.x, I'm rewriting all this using new [GTK4 bindings](https://github.com/hugopl/gtk4.cr)
and [LibAdwaita](https://github.com/GeopJr/libadwaita.cr), the re-write isn't done yet but if you want to check the old version check some v0.7.x tag.

The [TODO](./TODO.md) works like a roadmap and also list things I'm working on, it can give you a better idea of the project
status.

## How it looks like?

## Project goals

- Run fast, something you don't see very often in new desktop applications.
- Have a simple distraction free UI.
- Keyboard focused user interface.
- Easy/fast code navigation.
- ♥️ Git.
- ♥️ [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).

## Installing

### Archlinux

There's a AUR package for every release.

```
$ yay -S tijolo
```

There's also AUR package available for latest git version, named `tijolo-git`.

### Ubuntu

There should be a home made Ubuntu package for every release, check the
[github release page](https://github.com/hugopl/tijolo/releases).

If you want to create a package from git, clone the repository then run `./packages/make-ubuntu-package`, this will generate
a docker image, build Tijolo inside that image, create a debian package then copy it back, out of the container. Not best
approach to build a deb package but works on non-deb machines.

## Dependencies

You will need:

 - Crystal compiler version >= 1.0.0.
 - GTK3.
 - GTKSourceView4.
 - [Vte](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte).
 - GIR packages for these GTK libraries.
 - [libGit2](https://libgit2.org/).
 - [editorconfig-core](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c).

### via apt

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install -y \
    git make crystal libeditorconfig-dev \
    libgirepository1.0-dev libgit2-dev \
    libgtksourceview-4-dev libvte-2.91-dev libyaml-dev
```

Names and versions may differ depending on distro and version

### via Homebrew/Linuxbrew

```shell
$ brew install crystal gtk+3 gobject-introspection gtksourceview4 vte3 \
               libgit2 editorconfig
```

### Other package managers

Check your distro's package managers for the equivalent package names. You will
need the install the `-dev` or `-devel` equivalent packages, in addition to the
runtime packages.

## Compiling from Source

```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Tijolo use [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font, you can _make install_ them if you don't already have
them installed:

```
$ sudo make install-fonts
```

To uninstall:

```
$ sudo make uninstall uninstall-fonts
```
