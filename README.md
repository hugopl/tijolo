# Archived

I'm a nvim user nowadays, so farewell Tijolo, rest in piece.

# Tijolo

Lightweight, keyboard-oriented IDE for the masses.

[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/tijolo)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tijolo)
![Build Status](https://github.com/hugopl/tijolo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Project status

Basic stuff still missing, use it at your own risk üî•Ô∏è.

Currently it uses the GtkSourceView as code widget, but due to limitations
of GtkSOurceView I plan to embed neovim in Tijolo, so Tijolo would only take care
of the split panes and start a nvim instance with tijolo's own init files.

I started to code a code widget... but it's too much work for my spare time.

## How it looks like?

See more [screenshots](https://github.com/hugopl/tijolo/tree/master/screenshots).

## Project goals

- Run fast, something you don't see very often in new desktop applications.
- Have a simple distraction free UI.
- Keyboard focused user interface.
- Easy/fast code navigation.
- ‚ô•Ô∏è Git.
- ‚ô•Ô∏è [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).

## Installing

### Archlinux

There's a AUR package for every release.

```
$ yay -S tijolo
```

There's also AUR package available for latest git version, named `tijolo-git`.

### Ubuntu

There should be a home made Ubuntu package for every release, check the
[github release page](https://github.com/hugopl/tijolo/releases).

If you want to create a package from git, clone the repository then run `./packages/make-ubuntu-package`, this will generate
a docker image, build Tijolo inside that image, create a debian package then copy it back, out of the container. Not best
approach to build a deb package but works on non-deb machines.

## Dependencies

You will need:

 - Crystal compiler version >= 1.10.0.
 - GTK4 >= 4.8.
 - LibAdwaita >= 1.4.
 - GTKSourceView5.
 - [Vte4](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte).
 - GIR packages for these GTK libraries.

## Compiling from Source

```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Tijolo use [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font, you can _make install_ them if you don't already have
them installed:

```
$ sudo make install-fonts
```

To uninstall:

```
$ sudo make uninstall uninstall-fonts
```

To update GTK4 icon cache and compile gschema files run:

```
$ make post-install
```

## Usage

Pass a directory of a file under a git repository to open a project. Just call it without arguments to see a list of available projects.
